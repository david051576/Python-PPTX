A project completed in Openhack Microsoft (2017.12.03) 

This is a project which dedicates to help business man generate slide more efficiently.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the version 1.0 (only the "Important quoto" pattern), if you enter a quoto, it will google this quoto and scratch one of the greatest fit picture on Google, and put it in your slide.

However, you should turn the transparency in hand that you can see the background. (I cannot solve the transparency problem until now.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
In the version 2.0, feature will be like,


Pattern #1 Important quote (finished)  
               (1) Quote you want to emphasize
               
Pattern #2 Issue with photo  
               (1) Title you want to include  
               (2) Paragraphs you want to include  
               (3) Photo's keywords (you can put the title's name)  

Pattern #3 Two concepts  
               (1) Title you want to include   
               (2) Concept one  
               (3) Paragragh one  
               (4) Concept two  
               (5) Paragraph two
